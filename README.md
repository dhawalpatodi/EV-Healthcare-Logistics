# Evaluating Electric Vehicle Adoption in Healthcare Logistics  

This repository contains the data-driven research project titled **"Evaluating Electric Vehicle Adoption in Healthcare Logistics"**, conducted during my internship as a **Data Research Intern at Medcords Healthcare Solutions**.  

While Medcords is primarily a healthcare technology firm, it also provides **transportation services** for hospitals and clinics, including ambulances, staff shuttles, and medical supply vehicles. Since transportation is essential to healthcare delivery, Medcords has been exploring sustainable mobility options to cut costs and reduce emissions. My internship project focused on evaluating how **electric vehicle (EV) technology** can support this transition.

## Key Contributions  

- Researched the role of **electric vehicles in healthcare logistics**, with emphasis on ambulances, medical supply vans, and staff transport.  
- Analyzed EV adoption trends, including **40% YoY growth (2022–23)** and a projected **35% global EV market share by 2030**.  
- Compared operating costs of ambulances, showing EVs could deliver **60–70% cost savings** (₹2–3/km vs. ₹9–10/km fuel).  
- Estimated that converting **10 hospital vehicles to EVs could cut ~120 tons of CO₂ annually**, demonstrating the environmental benefits for healthcare.
